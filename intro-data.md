# Introduction to Data

(from Foundational Learning Modules google doc):
- Copy module repo
- Activate GH Pages?
- Use csv from repo, upload to sheets
- Follow steps to edit sheets using formulas, etc.
- Add/commit csv to repo--possibly updates a visualization?

# Step 1. Copy this GitHub Repository

Copy code from another repository into your own and start editing it.

1. Make sure you're logged into your account on [GitHub](https://github.com)
2. Scroll to the top of the [foundations-0-github](https://github.com/learn-static/foundations-0-github) repository and click the green "Use This Template" button (appears on the right side above the code area)
4. This brings you to a "Create a new repository" form. Follow these steps:
    1. In the **Repository name** text box, give your repository the name `data-foundations`. If you'd like to create your own name for the repository, be sure to use a lowercase name without spaces or odd characters. Dashes (`-`) or underscores (`_`) are okay.
    2. In the **Description** text box, add `A place to learn metadata basics`.
    3. Select the option for "**Public**" repository.
    4. Leave the "Include all branches" option **Unchecked**!
    5. Click on the green button "**Create repository from template**". This will take you to your new repository.

## Activate GitHub Pages

1. On your project repository's home page, click the "Settings" button (appears on the right along the tabs above the code area).
2. On "Settings" page: click "Pages" in the left side menu.
3. On the "Pages" page: in the "Source" section, change the dropdown button from "none" to "main" (leave the folder option as "/root"), then click the "Save" button. 

Once saved, the page will refresh with an alert providing the URL where your site will appear. 
It will take a few minutes for the build to happen and your site to go live--so wait it out! 

Meanwhile, you might want to copy the URL to display on your home page:

1. Copy the provided URL.
2. Go to repository's home page.
3. On right side of the code area, look for "About" section and click on the cog icon to edit. 
4. In the "About" box, paste in your URL, then click "Save". This will make it easy to access the site in the future!
